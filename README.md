### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I thought the labs were good in preparing me, especially lab two as it gave me a good introduction into react and the fundamentals that allowed me to start my weekly assignment. My main struggle was getting too far into the weekly assignment compared to where we were at with the labs, so I would look ahead to see what I needed to know in order to progress. This method generally kept me moving smoothly in the assignment and also helped strengthen my React skills.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would go deeper into the styling, as I think it is one of my weaker areas as a software engineer since in the past I have had to put little effort into it compared to other features. This time I went further than last week in styling, and learned some good techniques, but I think there is room for improvement. I would also like to learn how to make a backend where the website remembers which movies you liked and have watched, which would add to the functionality of the webstie.
  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went really well! Everyone got to share their part. I thought that some people did a really good job emulating netflixes modal for when you click on a movie, and I think that if I did that it would greatly enance the visual appeal of my project.
